# Answerly

A modern question-answering system leveraging transformer-based models to extract precise answers from documents with state-of-the-art accuracy.

## Overview

Answerly integrates advanced NLP capabilities with an intuitive interface, enabling rapid information extraction from text documents. The system employs a multi-model architecture to optimize for both speed and accuracy across diverse document types.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React 19.0 + TypeScript
- Responsive CSS architecture, no external dependencies
- Component-driven architecture with atomic design principles

### Backend
- FastAPI with asynchronous request handling
- Optimized model loading with platform-specific acceleration
- Intelligent text chunking and document processing pipeline

### Model Architecture
- Transformer-based QA models (BERT variants)
- Model selection system with performance optimization
- Platform-aware acceleration (CUDA, MPS, CPU)

## Core Capabilities

- Text-based and document-based question answering
- Multi-model inference with confidence scoring
- Dynamic text chunking for large documents
- PDF processing with OCR fallback
- Cross-platform deployment with hardware acceleration

## Development Status

Initial architecture implementation. Currently focusing on frontend system architecture, API integration patterns, and UX design. Backend systems have been tested with sample documents and demonstrate expected behavior across multiple model types.

## Development Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | System Architecture | Completed |
| 2 | Core Backend Services | Completed |
| 3 | Frontend Foundation | In Progress |
| 4 | Advanced Text Processing | Planned |
| 5 | Performance Optimization | Planned |
| 6 | Extended Model Support | Planned |

## Implementation Notes

The system is built with scalability in mind, utilizing a microservice architecture that separates document processing, model management, and request handling. Text processing follows a staged approach with progressive refinement to optimize for both accuracy and latency.

## API Documentation

API documentation will be auto-generated at `/api/docs` once the system is in running state.
